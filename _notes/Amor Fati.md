From Latin, may be translated as "love of fate" or "loves ones fate".

Used a lot in Stoicism and is used to describe the attitude that every situation in life is necessary. This includes suffering and loss, and refers to any situations that are out of your personal control. 

## [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]
There are many references to this idea in Nietzsche work particularly around his tough experience and novel discussing the [[Eternal Recurrence]]. 

> I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who makes things beautiful. _Amor fati_: let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. _Looking away_ shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer. - The Gay Science section 276

His reference to the Yes-sayer is those capable of acceptance of any situation and in many ways lead a zen life.
