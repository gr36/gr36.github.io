So there must be some evolutionary advantage to stress and anxiety due to the upwards slope of the curve. This usually manifests itself in situations that are novel, unpredictable, not controllable and often a social evaluative threat. 

But at some point it starts to counter the intended effects. In modern life this expresses itself in expecting catastrophic events and stressing about modern life things. Some stress is productive, and in some situation where it is not felt from external sources (needing to get food etc) we may look to gain this ourselves.
