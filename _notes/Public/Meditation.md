### A Collection Of Quotes

> this was an extremely humiliating, an important experience because it made me realise for the first time in my life that I have almost no control over my mind - Yuval Noah Harari

> It seems bizarre the first time you try out a guided mediation and you can’t concentrate on your breathing for more than a few moments. Utterly humbling, a bit of a shock, and I wonder how many people will give up here because they think this is failing.

> Journaling is an offshoot of meditation—a type of introspection where a record of events is welcome. It doesn’t have to mean the record is permanent. In fact, it’s probably better as ephemeral—permanently locked behind a password. But, the fact that it exists is a comfort in itself. - [CJ Chilvers](https://dayoneapp.com/blog/streak-story-cj-chilvers/)
