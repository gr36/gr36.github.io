Study by [Halpern et al 2015](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1414293)

This discusses the innate motivation the comes from avoiding a punishment as apposed to receiving a reward. 
- a control group was offered educational information and traditional methods, such as free nicotine patches, to encourage smoking cessation. After six months, 6 per cent of people in the control group had stopped smoking. The next group, called the ‘reward group’, was offered $800 if they had stopped smoking after six months – 17 per cent of them were successful. However, the third group of participants provided the most interesting results. In this group, called the ‘deposit group’, participants were required to make a precommitment deposit of $150 of their own money with a pledge to be smoking-free after six months. If, and only if, they reached their goal, they would receive the $150 deposit back. In addition to recouping their cash, successful ‘deposit’ group participants would also receive a $650 bonus prize (as opposed to the $800 offered to the ‘reward’ participants) from their employer. The results? Of those who accepted the deposit challenge, an astounding 52 per cent succeeded in meeting their goal!

Meaning that losing a financial incentive means more to an individual the gaining a bonus income.
Creating a financial pact with yourself (or anyone else) only goes so far
