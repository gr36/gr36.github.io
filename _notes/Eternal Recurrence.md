There are hints in ancient writings that the theory of eternal return may have originated with Pythagoras (c. 570 – c. 495 BC) however the idea was common with Stoicism that time repeats itself in a constant loop and that exactly the same events will happen over and over again.

According to Stoic belief the universe will periodically destroy itself only to experience exactly the same life cycle over again. 

## [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] Thought Experiment

> What if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness, and say to you, "This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence" ... Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: "You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine."

This experiment appears in The Gay Science, section 341 which is expanded on in Thus Spoke Zarathustra stating that the eternal return was "the fundamental idea of the work".

### My Interpretation
Could you put up with suffering better if you knew that better times were coming. That the experience would som how make you stronger. IF you had lived this experience before and already knew that you will look back on this suffering with a better understanding and [[Amor Fati]] (love your fate)?

The protagonist in Thus Spoke Zarathustra is at first overcome with the thought of reliving things exactly the same but embraces it as his 'most fervent desire' in the end. With the thought that you can indeed live your greatest happiness again, and be more able to cope with the suffering.
