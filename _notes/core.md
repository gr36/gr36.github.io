title: The Core Principle
---
Made famous by [Dave Brailsford](https://themindfulworkweek.com/2015/12/31/the-core-principle-and-the-aggregation-of-marginal-gains/), the CORE principle can apply to many areas.

Commitment: The CORE Principle taught that motivation changes but commitment and attitude need to stay consistent to be successful. Commitment is about having an intrinsic drive towards achieving a goal and taking ownership of your training, development and performance.

Ownership: The CORE principle of ownership is that you take initiative and have a say in what you’re doing. Brailsford says ownership is also about having an opinion and as a leader creating an open environment for transparency. Riders were encouraged to have a say in their development and their coaching programs.

Responsibility: The CORE principle of responsibility is about being clear about accountability. What are you accountable for and what are you not accountable for? What is and isn’t expected of your attitude and performance?

Excellence: The CORE Principle of excellence is about being the best you can be. What is your standard of excellence, and the standard of excellence for what you want to achieve?
