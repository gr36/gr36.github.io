title: Systems And Tools
---

The system is the most important thing, isn’t it. The tools will fall around the system, or they start to dictate the system it’s self. If a tool I use can’t do the job I want it to do, do I then find a different tool or change my system and expectations. 

The risk is that changing the tool every time is costly, in both time and money, but I don’t want a tool that doesn’t do what I want it to do. Is there a difference between want and need here?

The system currently is broken, not in terms of taking notes, but using the notes later on. Linking between thoughts and surfacing ideas has never worked as well as it did with Roam. Yet, the reality is that it didn’t work well on mobile and was extortionate. 

At this point, anything is better than nothing.
