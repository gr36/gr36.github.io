title: Zero Click Content
---
People do not want to click on the links that you post on social media for two reasons.
1.  People are lazy - we don’t want to click on links that take us away from our current platform.
2.  Algorithms reward platform-native content - they don’t promote content that pushes users away from their own platform.

So it is important to craft as much content for that specific network and make it as easy to access as possible. Not only will this benefit the user, but also the social network itself will promote you content wider. 

> It’s harder than ever to get audiences to click that call-to-action” - [Amanda Natividad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandanat/)

Zero-Click content is content that offers valuable, standalone insights (or simply engaging material), with no need to click. This is content that’s native to any platform — a Twitter thread, a LinkedIn post, a 60-second TikTok that immediately jumps into the “how to” demonstration. It’s easily consumed by anyone scrolling their feed, yet still provides value to the creator.

Researching and writing a simple how to post on [DJI spark controller](https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/how-to-reset/) lead to thousands of page views every month. Then Google pulled all the information out and placed it on there page which means no more clicks. This is great business practice for them because not only do they retain the user but they know that they don't want to click away from the platform they are using anyway.
